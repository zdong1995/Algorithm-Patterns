# 1. Array/String

Array is the first linear data structure when we learn programming, and it is the fundamental of our algorithm knowledge. Array and String are very similar, as `int[]` and `char[]` respectively. Thus for string related problem we can use `toCharArray()` method to convert into array to solve in the same idea.

The commonly used idea in solving these problems are Two Pointers, Binary Search, Quick Selection, Count Sort, Dynamic Programming and utilization of data structure HashMap, Heap, Stack, Bit Map, etc. In this chapter we will discuss the popular pattern and algorithms in Array/String problems.

### 1. [Sorting Algorithm](1.1-sorting-algorithm.md)

* [ ] Merge Sort
* [ ] Quick Sort
* [ ] Selection Sort

### 2. [Two Sum Pattern](1.2-two-sum.md)

* 2 Sum - Unsorted/Sorted
* 2 Sum - Greater/Smaller/Closest/Difference
* 2 Sum - All Pairs/All Unique Pairs/Data Structure Design
* 3 Sum - Greater/Closest/Smaller/All Unique Pairs
* 4 Sum
* K Sum
